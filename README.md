# Binary-Tree-Functions

Created the following functions for Binary Search Trees:

• range(): returns the range of values stored in a binary search tree of integers. The
range of values equals the maximum value in the binary search tree minus the minimum value. 

• get_level(): that takes as input the level and returns a list of all the nodes at that level
from left to right. If that level does not exist for that binary search tree return an empty list .

• left_side_view(): when given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the
left side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

• sum_leaf_nodes():  returns the sum of the value of all leaves.
